# LearningJavaScript
Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository will serve as a dedicated space where I document and share my journey as I begin to learn JavaScript. As I progress through various tutorials, projects, and exercises, I will be using this repository to track my accomplishments, challenges, and discoveries. Here, you will find code samples, project notes, and reflections on my learning experiences. I hope to build a comprehensive record of my growth and development in JavaScript, and this repository will be a valuable resource for both my future reference and for anyone interested in following my learning path.

July 26 2024 : First day of learning JS, passed basic JS course on an app called Encode in roughly 1h. 

Now starting to code my first mini "app", fizzbuzz : The FizzBuzz algorithm is a classic programming challenge used in interviews and coding exercises. The goal is to write a program that prints a sequence of numbers with specific substitutions based on divisibility rules. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the FizzBuzz algorithm:
-Print numbers from 1 to 100 (or another range) with the following rules:
-For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
-For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
-For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
-For all other numbers, print the number itself.
